## Requirements

+ Arduino
+ Arduino IDE or any other arduino compatible IDE
+ DHT library of arduino
+ DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
+ Ultrasonic Distance sensor
+ Buzzer for alarm

## How to Run

Simple Steps to build the project:
  1. Wire the data pins of DHT-11 to digital pin 10.
  2. Wire the echo pin of ultrasonic sound sensor to the digital pin 6.
  3. Wire the trigger pin of ultrasonic sound sensor to the digital pin 4.
  4. To install the DHT library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for "DHT sensor library" and install the library.
  5. Open the HeatStroke_prevention.ino file in the Arduino IDE and upload to the board using appropriate settings.
